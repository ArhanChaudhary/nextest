# Wrapper scripts

<!-- md:version 0.9.98 -->

!!! experimental "Experimental: This feature is not yet stable"

    - **Enable with:** Add `experimental = ["wrapper-scripts"]` to `.config/nextest.toml`
    - **Tracking issue:** [#2384](https://github.com/nextest-rs/nextest/issues/2384)

Nextest supports wrapping test execution with custom commands via _wrapper scripts_.

Wrapper scripts can be scoped to:

- Particular tests via [filtersets](../filtersets/index.md)
- And to particular platforms.

Wrapper scripts are configured in two parts: _defining scripts_, and _setting up rules_ for when they should be executed.

## Defining scripts

Wrapper scripts are defined using the top-level `[scripts.wrapper]` configuration. For example, to define a script named "my-script", which runs `my-script.sh`:

```toml title="Wrapper script definition in <code>.config/nextest.toml</code>"
[scripts.wrapper.my-script]
command = 'my-script.sh'
```

Commands can either be specified using Unix shell rules, or as a list of arguments. In the following example, `script1` and `script2` are equivalent.

```toml
[scripts.wrapper.script1]
command = 'script.sh -c "Hello, world!"'

[scripts.wrapper.script2]
command = ['script.sh', '-c', 'Hello, world!']
```

Commands can also be interpreted as relative to the target directory. This does not change the working directory of the testâ€”it just prepends the target directory to the command if it is relative.

```toml
[scripts.wrapper.script1]
command = { command-line = "debug/my-wrapper-bin", relative-to = "target" }
```

A wrapper script will be invoked with the test binary as the first argument, and the argument list passed in as subsequent arguments.

### Wrapper script configuration

Wrapper scripts can have the following configuration options attached to them:

- **`target-runner`**: Interaction with [target runners](../features/target-runners.md), if one is specified. The following values are permitted:

  - **`within-wrapper`**: Run the target runner as an argument the wrapper script. For example, if the target runner is `qemu-arm` and the wrapper is `valgrind --leak-check=full`, the full command that's run is `valgrind --leak-check=full qemu-arm <test-binary> <args...>`.

  - **`around-wrapper`**: Run the wrapper script as an argument to the target runner. For example, if the target runner is `my-linux-emulator` and the wrapper is `sudo`, then the full command that's run is `my-linux-emulator sudo <test-binary> <args...>`.

  - **`overrides-wrapper`**: The wrapper script is disabled, and only the target runner is used.

  - **`ignore`**: The target runner is disabled, and only the wrapper script is used.

## Setting up rules

In configuration, you can create rules for when to use scripts on a per-profile basis. This is done via the `profile.<profile-name>.scripts` array.

Wrapper scripts can be invoked:

* While listing tests, with the `list-wrapper` instruction
* While running tests, with the `run-wrapper` instruction
* Or both, if both `list-wrapper` and `run-wrapper` are specified.

### Examples

In some situations, tests must be run as root. Here's an example of setting up `sudo` on Linux in CI, assuming you have configured your CI to allow `sudo` without prompting:

```toml title="Basic rules"
[scripts.wrapper.sudo-script]
command = 'sudo'

[[profile.ci.scripts]]
filter = 'test(root_tests)'
# A platform can also be specified.
platform = { host = 'cfg(target_os = "linux")' }
run-wrapper = 'sudo-script'
```

As shown above, wrapper scripts can also filter based on platform, using the rules listed in [_Specifying platforms_](specifying-platforms.md).

In some cases you may also need to use a wrapper for listing tests. For example:

```toml title="Using a wrapper for both listing and running tests"
[scripts.wrapper.wine-script]
command = 'wine'

[[profile.windows-tests.scripts]]
filter = 'binary(windows_compat_tests)'
list-wrapper = 'wine-script'
run-wrapper = 'wine-script'
```

If `list-wrapper` is specified, `filter` cannot contain `test()` or `default()` predicates, since those predicates can only be evaluated after listing is completed.

## Wrapper script precedence

Wrapper scripts follow the same precedence order as [per-test settings](per-test-overrides.md#override-precedence).

* The `list-wrapper` and `run-wrapper` configurations are evaluated separately.
* Only the first wrapper script that matches a test is run.
